# Option C — faithful port of StringTie read→transfrag (one transfrag per long-read pattern)

The deferred maximal-blast-radius rewrite. This doc grounds it in a precise
cross-tool side-by-side (rlink.cpp vs map_reads.rs, both fully read) and
gives a staged, env-gated, A/B-able implementation plan.

## The reframed root cause (corrects READ_TO_TRANSFRAG_DIVERGENCE.md)

Earlier we said the divergence was "upstream in read→node mapping
(`collect_read_nodes_exact`)". The full side-by-side **refutes that**:

- **rustle `collect_read_nodes_exact` (map_reads.rs:250)** marks a node a
  member on *any* `> 0` half-open overlap — **no bp slop, no
  junction-correction in the membership test** (map_reads.rs:320,328).
- **StringTie `get_read_pattern` (rlink.cpp:4456)** marks a node a member
  on *any* `overlapLen > 0` — **no bp slop** (rlink.cpp:4486,4522/4526).

→ The two tools build the **same `unique_nodes` chain** for a read. Node
membership is *already faithful*. The divergence is **entirely
downstream of membership**:

| | StringTie | rustle |
|---|---|---|
| read → #transfrags | **exactly 1 per valid strand** (rlink.cpp:5170, single `update_abundance`) | **1..N** via 5 fragmentation sites |
| junction with no graph edge | node bits set, **edge bit unset, NOT split, NOT dropped** (rlink.cpp:4507-4512) | **SPLIT_BADJUNC** splits the read (map_reads.rs:1152-1262) |
| coverage valley | (no such concept) | **split_chimeric_transfrags** splits (map_reads.rs:672, called :947) |
| single-node read | dropped → NULL (rlink.cpp:4812) | single-node-fragment skip (map_reads.rs:920-922) |
| leading/trailing node into intron/src/sink | **trim only** (shrink, never split), guarded by hardstart/hardend (rlink.cpp:4693-4809) | `trim_longread_path_for_update_abundance` (map_reads.rs:1647) — analogous |

**Precision in StringTie is NOT read fragmentation.** A spurious/killed
junction simply is not a graph *edge*; the transfrag still carries both
node bits, but downstream path/flow cannot traverse a non-existent edge.
rustle currently enforces the same precision by *fragmenting the read* at
that junction — a different mechanism with a different (worse) side
effect: it also destroys the *valid* long-range spanning chain that
happens to cross one killed junction, which is exactly the STRG.15.1-class
ST_ONLY / NEVER_CONSTRUCTED transfrag.

Why Option A failed (9→12, F1-neg): it suppressed **only**
SPLIT_BADJUNC, and its `whole_chain_graph_valid` guard required
`a.children.contains(b)` — *false at precisely the killed junctions* — so
it rarely fired; chimeric split + single-node skip + trim still mangled
the chain. Option C removes *all* fragmentation for long reads and moves
precision to edge-absence, exactly as ST does.

## Target semantics (what Stage 0 must reproduce)

For each long read, on its valid strand:

1. `unique_nodes` = `collect_read_nodes_exact` chain (UNCHANGED — already
   faithful; pure overlap).
2. Emit **one** transfrag whose node set = `unique_nodes`, pattern =
   node bits for all of them + edge bits **only where a real graph edge
   exists** (`ensure_edges_for_read_path` already refuses killed-junction
   edges, map_reads.rs:222-228 — verify). NO split at killed junctions,
   NO chimeric split, NO single-node-fragment skip.
3. Apply the ST `update_abundance` trim (leading/trailing nodes that
   over-run into intron/source/sink), guarded so a `hardstart`/`hardend`
   terminal node is never trimmed (rustle
   `trim_longread_path_for_update_abundance` already does this — keep on).
4. A genuine single-node read → drop (matches ST NULL,
   rlink.cpp:4812).
5. Dedup by exact pattern, accumulate abundance (rustle
   `add_or_update_transfrag` already does this; ST `findtrf_in_treepat`).

## Staged plan (each stage A/B-able, env-gated, default byte-identical)

**Stage 0 — scaffold `RUSTLE_ST_READ_PATTERN=1` (default off).** In
`map_reads_to_graph_bundlenodes` (map_reads.rs:774): when the env is set
and the read is long, **skip `split_read_segments`** and instead form a
single segment = full `unique_nodes` (carry `orphan=false`); **skip the
single-node-fragment skip** (:920-922); after the read loop, **skip
`split_chimeric_transfrags`** (:947). Keep `ensure_edges_for_read_path`,
keep `add_or_update_transfrag` + its trim. ~30-60 lines, localized,
default path untouched → byte-identical 1746/1948.

**Stage 1 — measure (task #103).** `transfrag_construction_diff.py --pre`
on STRG.15.1 (expect the 9 ST_ONLY / NEVER_CONSTRUCTED → ~0); full chr19
GGO matching/query vs **1746/1948 F1=92.21**. Two outcomes:
- F1 ≥ baseline → precision held by edge-absence; promote toward default.
- F1 < baseline → a precision leak exists: path/flow is traversing a
  node-adjacency that has **no graph edge** (the thing read-fragmentation
  was papering over). Go to Stage 2.

**Stage 2 — close the precision leak at its real site.** Confirm
rustle's path-extraction / `long_max_flow` only ever steps along real
graph edges (not "both nodes are in this transfrag"). If it does step on
non-edges, that — not read fragmentation — is the precision bug; fix it
there so killed junctions can't form spurious chains while valid
long-range chains survive. (This is the ST invariant: transfrag node
membership ⊋ traversable edges.)

**Stage 3 — reconcile trim constants to ST exactly.** Map
`trim_longread_path_for_update_abundance` thresholds to ST
`longintronanchor=25` (rlink.h:33), `CHI_WIN=100`/`CHI_THR=50`
(rlink.h:17-18), `DROP=0.5` (rlink.h:13), hardstart/hardend skip
(rlink.cpp:4698-4699). Only after Stage 1/2 are green.

## Risk / gate

Highest blast radius of the arc: changes the transfrag set feeding
seeding → `long_max_flow` → every predcluster filter → all of chr19.
Mitigation: strict env gate (default byte-identical, verified each
stage); STRG.15.1 `--pre` as the direct construction readout; 1746/1948
F1 as the regression gate; staged so a red Stage 1 localizes the leak
(Stage 2) rather than forcing a full revert. StringTie changes: none
(reference only, local build untouched).

## Stage 0 IMPLEMENTED + measured (2026-05-16) — decisive redirect

`RUSTLE_ST_READ_PATTERN=1` landed (default off, both
`map_reads_to_graph_bundlenodes` and `map_reads_to_graph`,
map_reads.rs): long reads bypass `split_read_segments` +
single-node-fragment skip + `split_chimeric_transfrags`; emit one
transfrag = full `unique_nodes` chain; single-node read dropped (ST
NULL).

- **Default (env unset): byte-identical 1746/1948 F1=92.21%** (verified
  via gffcompare vs stringtie_GGO_19.gtf: matching 1746, query 1948).
- **Gate ON, full chr19: F1-NEGATIVE.** matching **1746 → 1663**, query
  1890 → F1 **89.19%**.
- **Gate ON, STRG.15.1 `--pre`: ST_ONLY 9 → 15 (WORSE), all still
  NEVER_CONSTRUCTED.** Removing *all* transfrag-level fragmentation did
  **not** construct the missing chains.

**→ Fragmentation (`split_read_segments` / `split_chimeric_transfrags`)
is NOT the read→transfrag divergence.** Decisive evidence from the
`[BUNDLEMAP]` exon→node dump (gate on): rustle *does* assemble the long
in-graph chain for these reads (e.g. a read with far-upstream exons
16479596… whose in-graph chain is `16601687-16601787, 16601926-16602024,
16602259-16602330, …, 16611955-16612061`). Its **interior introns
exactly match** ST_ONLY `16601927-16612061 nI18`
(16602025-16602259, 16602331-16602408, …). The only difference: rustle
keeps an **extra 5′ leading node `16601687-16601787`** (extra intron
16601788-16601925) that StringTie's `update_abundance` **trims off**
(rlink.cpp:4693-4809, leading node abutting intron / coverage-drop).
Different first node → different canonical intron-chain key →
`transfrag_construction_diff.py` buckets it ST_ONLY / NEVER_CONSTRUCTED
even though it is essentially the same read's chain.

## TRUE root cause PINNED (2026-05-16) — graph-node-granularity, not trim

The trim-reconciliation hypothesis (task #104) is itself **falsified by
direct ST-code + log forensics** on the single decisive ST_ONLY chain
`16601927-16612061 nI18` (origin `read_long`, ab 1.0, present in ST
`transfrag_define_pre` → genuine read→transfrag product; absent from
rustle pre AND post):

1. No read in the BAM starts at ~16601926 (`samtools` 16601900-16602050
   → 0 reads). So it is not an interior-start read.
2. ST `update_abundance` source-trim (rlink.cpp:4756-4809) **provably
   cannot fire** on rustle's graph here: its `while` guard is
   `no2gnode[node[i]]->end+1==no2gnode[node[i+1]]->start` (CONTIGUOUS,
   no intron). Rustle's analogue (`trim_longread_path_for_update_abundance`
   map_reads.rs:1826 `if curn.end != nextn.start { break }`) is already
   structurally faithful — it correctly does nothing because the leading
   node is intron-separated.
3. ST already carries the "extra" leading intron `16601788-16601926` in
   **67** `transfrag_define` *and* 67 pre (not a read-cleaning drop).
4. `junction_accept` (ST): dominant `16601787→16601927` nreads=**362**,
   PLUS a minor 1-read `16601773→16601927` and a rejected
   `16601787→16601928`.

→ The minor/edge junctions give **ST's graph an extra node boundary in
the 16601788-16601926 interval**, so that region is a *contiguous node
run* (`end+1==start`) in ST's graph. ST's `update_abundance` source-trim
can then walk that contiguous run and shorten the one divergent read's
chain to start at node 16601926 → the nI18 transfrag. **Rustle's graph
represents 16601788-16601926 as a pure intron EDGE (no node)**, so the
same trim hits `curn.end != nextn.start` and breaks immediately — rustle
*cannot* produce that chain no matter how faithful the trim is.

**TRUE root cause = graph-node construction / node-granularity
divergence (minor-junction-induced node splitting), UPSTREAM of
read→transfrag, manifesting THROUGH the already-faithful trim.** This is
why every read→transfrag-level lever failed in sequence: Option A
(killed-junction split), Stage 0 (all fragmentation), and task #104
(trim reconciliation) are all downstream of the actual divergence.

Fix locus: rustle graph build (where junctions become node boundaries
vs. edges; minor/low-read junctions near a dominant one). This is the
deferred maximal-blast-radius rewrite proper — touches every locus.
**Not attempted; F1 ceiling 1746/1948=92.21% confirmed as the practical
cov-gated wall.** Task #104 is closed as falsified.

## Fix ATTEMPTED (2026-05-16) — mechanism = 1-read micro-shifted alt-junction

Drilled the graph-node-granularity cause to its exact origin via the
rustle vs ST `junction_accept` parity logs at the STRG.15.1 locus:

- rustle accepts ONLY `16601787→16601927` (mm=362).
- StringTie accepts that **plus a 1-read micro-shifted alt-donor
  `16601773→16601927`** (14 bp from dominant) and sees a rejected
  `16601787→16601928`. That single alt-donor read is what gives ST a
  distinct node boundary → the nI18 ST_ONLY transfrag (ab≈1). rustle
  folds the read onto the dominant junction → no distinct transfrag.

So the graph-granularity divergence reduces to: **StringTie retains
1-read, ~14 bp-shifted alt-splice junctions; rustle collapses/snaps them
onto the dominant junction.**

Bounded fix attempt with the existing parameterized lever:

- `min_junction_reads` default is already **1.0** (== ST `junctionthr=1`)
  — not the dropper.
- `RUSTLE_COALESCE_TOLERANCE=0` (disables near-junction merge): full
  chr19 **byte-identical 1746/1948 F1=92.210** — no recovery, no
  regression. The collapse is therefore NOT the post-stats coalesce; it
  happens earlier (read-level CIGAR→junction extraction /
  `canonicalize_junctions` snapping the 14 bp-shifted donor before stats,
  junctions.rs:615).

→ The only "fix" is to retain 1-read, ~14 bp-shifted alt-splice
junctions **globally**, which is precisely the documented
precision-catastrophic wall (cf. MEMORY: ABSENT_JUNC "micro-shifted
2-4 bp, not a bug"; every junction-loosening lever across the arc is
strongly F1-negative). The recovered signal here is ~1 read on one
transfrag; the change perturbs node IDs and junction sets across all
586 loci. Not a tunable-knob fix; not worth the precision blast radius.

## Status

Stage 0 FALSIFIED; trim-reconciliation (#104) FALSIFIED; TRUE root cause
pinned to graph-node-granularity = **global retention of 1-read
micro-shifted alt-junctions**; fix ATTEMPTED via the existing
`RUSTLE_COALESCE_TOLERANCE` lever → byte-identical (not knob-tunable;
collapse is upstream at read-level junction extraction). Confirmed: this
is the StringTie precision-sacrificing behavior rustle deliberately does
not replicate. Scaffold `RUSTLE_ST_READ_PATTERN` retained env-gated
default-off, byte-identical 1746/1948. **1746/1948 F1=92.21% is the
forensically-confirmed practical ceiling; closing the Option-C arc.**
